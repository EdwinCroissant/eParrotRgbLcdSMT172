I designed the PCB's with Kicad and ordered the boards at PCBWay.com.
The quality is excellent and the manufacturing is fast.

I corrected some minor issues and attached the project and gerber files.

There are two versions, one with round holes for the barrel jack and one with slotted holes for the barrel jack.

When I started this I could not find out what the issue was with slotted holes, they seem to be problematic for some fabs. So I opted of round holes to be safe, first time after all.

The oval holes for the barrel jack are defined in the drill file and some fabs don't have the equipment read a drill file with oval holes, resulting in one small hole instead of a oval one. PCBWay has the equipment to make them. The round hole file is provided as backup.
